# Understand Host Names

MassEnergize's development workflow has three stages:

1. **Local**: This is where developers will spend most of the time making changes, fixing bugs, and adding new features.

2. **Dev**: Similar to local but instead of running database and API locally, they are available on the cloud.

3. **Canary** (aka staging): This is a replica of the production site where new changes are being tested before pushing to production.

4. **Production**: This is an actual version that users and admins will see.

:::note
There is an extra stage called **Dev** but there is no used to it for the moment.
